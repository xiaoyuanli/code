2. Indexing time extraction

See https://jira.splunk.com/browse/SPL-60142 as an example.

2.1 inputs.conf
 
[monitor://$SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\issue_app\sample_log]
disabled = false
followTail = 0
host_segment = 1
sourcetype = test_log

2.2 props.conf
 
[test_log]
TRANSFORMS-carId = carId_extract      // TRANSFORMS defines the index time extraction.

2.3 transforms.conf

[carId_extract]
REGEX =^\d\{2\}(?<carId>\S\{8\})
FORMAT = carId::"$1"

2.4 fields.conf

[carId]
INDEXED = true     // indexing into tsidx

 
3. Search time extraction

See http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.2.0/SearchReference/extract

Field will be extracted during search time.

For example:  ... | extract pairdelim="|;", kvdelim="=:"

 
4. Run field extractor from UI

http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.2.0/Knowledge/ExtractfieldsinteractivelywithIFX
